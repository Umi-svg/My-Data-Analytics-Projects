This project aims to build an analytical overview of AdventureWorks sales data by transforming raw tables into clear business insights. It focuses on identifying monthly sales trends, comparing online vs. non-online orders, analyzing delivery performance, ranking top salespeople, countries, and sales reasons, and proposing any additional insights valuable for the business. Using pivot tables, charts, lookup functions, and clean formatting, the project follows a structured data analysis approach—defining key business questions, preparing and cleaning the data, analyzing patterns, presenting findings, and suggesting actions. The final output is a well-designed Overview sheet supported by visuals and ready for a concise 5-minute presentation.

**Analysis and Findings:**
- Sales Trends: Sales grow from 2001-2004, with January weakest and August 2002/2003 peaks. Quarterly trends shift in July 2003, with third months leading, driven by price.
- Revenue: U.S. (58.58%, $82.4M) and Canada (15.28%, $21.5M) lead; 2004 projected at $90.6M.
- Sales Channels: Sales team drives 77% of revenue; online (23%) led by U.S. and Australia.
- Sales Reasons: Price (28%), untracked (24%), and promotions (21.35%) top online sales; quality fades post-2002.
- Performance: Delivery steady at 7 days; growth strong in North America.
- Top Performers: Linda Mitchell leads sales team by revenue; Jillian Carson tops by order count.

**Recommendations for Business:**
- Pricing & Promotions: Keep prices competitive and boost promotions, especially in Q1 to counter sales dips, as price (28%) and promotions (21.35%) drive online sales.
- Quality & Tracking: Maintain product quality and improve sales reason tracking by adding options, making selection mandatory, and refining “Other” with a free-form field; extend this to the sales team (77% of revenue) for better insights.
- Marketing Strategy: Reevaluate marketing efforts—TV ads and other campaigns show low impact—and redirect investments to higher-performing channels after investigation.
- Market Focus & Sales Team: Prioritize growth in the U.S. and Canada (74% of revenue), analyze overperforming U.S., Canadian, and French sales reps’ strategies, and replicate success elsewhere.
- Online Sales Boost: Investigate ways to increase online sales (23% of revenue) and self-checkout rates to reduce reliance on the costlier sales team channel.
