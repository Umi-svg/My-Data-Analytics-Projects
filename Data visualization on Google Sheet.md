This project aims to build an analytical overview of AdventureWorks sales data by transforming raw tables into clear business insights. It focuses on identifying monthly sales trends, comparing online vs. non-online orders, analyzing delivery performance, ranking top salespeople, countries, and sales reasons, and proposing any additional insights valuable for the business. Using pivot tables, charts, lookup functions, and clean formatting, the project follows a structured data analysis approach—defining key business questions, preparing and cleaning the data, analyzing patterns, presenting findings, and suggesting actions. The final output is a well-designed Overview sheet supported by visuals and ready for a concise 5-minute presentation.
