This project aims to build a clean and reliable sales funnel by transforming raw website event data into a structured sequence of unique user actions. It focuses on identifying one distinct event per user (based on the earliest timestamp), selecting 4–6 meaningful event types, and constructing a funnel chart that compares conversion patterns across the top three countries by event volume. The task requires writing SQL queries to deduplicate events, aggregate them by country, and prepare a funnel table including event order and drop-off percentages. The final deliverable includes a well-formatted funnel chart, supporting tables, and brief insights, along with a presentation explaining how the data was collected, validated, and translated into business-relevant findings.
