This project aims to choose one executive + department pair (Sales), build a clear strategic dashboard from AdventureWorks data, and prepare two tailored presentations (a ~5-minute executive pitch and a ~10-minute departmental briefing). The dashboard must be executive-ready—well labeled, branded, and structured—while supporting deeper tactical insights for the department lead, include data sources/SQL, clear metrics, and recommended next steps; presentations should explain the problem, key findings, business impact, limitations, and actionable recommendations.

**1. The Problem**

AdventureWorks demonstrates strong revenue growth (178% YoY in 2002–2003), but untapped potential exists due to:
- Regional imbalances: US Southeast/Northeast/Central underperform despite high market potential.
- Online channel gaps: 23% online sales (below industry 20–30% benchmark)
- Data blind spots: 24% of online sales lack tracked reasons, limiting customer insights.
- Low performance of some products and promotional campaigns

**2. Importance**

This leaves potential online revenue unaddressed and results in inefficient resource allocation (e.g., low-performing products, promotions). The current 23% online sales fall short of the industry standard of 20-30%, missing a potential $9.85M in additional revenue. Poor tracking obscures customer preferences, risking missed growth opportunities in a competitive market with a projected $8.6B U.S. bicycle industry in 2024.

**3. Proposed Solution and Organizational Benefits**

A strategic shift to double down on the US (58.6% of revenue), and close the 7% gap to industry standards (30% online share) can drive growth. This includes:
- Big Picture: Strengthens market position in the US and aligns with global trends, supporting a 36.19% YoY growth trajectory.
- Performance Metrics: Elevates online sales from 23% to 30% ($42.2M, adding $9.85M), reduces underperforming product losses (8 accessories < $10K), and stabilizes Q1 dips (e.g., January 2002-2004) by targeting untapped markets.
- Cost-Benefit Analysis:

> Untapped Markets: Launch targeted online campaigns in US Southeast/Northeast/Central (currently 0% online penetration) to unlock new revenue.

> Mandate sales reason tracking at checkout (reduce 24% "Untracked" gap): Add more sales reasons to the list and make it mandatory for customers to select one when purchasing, and change the sales reason "Other" or add a mandatory free-form field next to it so customers can specify their reason.

> Prune Low-Performers: Discontinue 8 accessories (<$10K sales; save 5% inventory costs) and bundle low-margin items (e.g., socks) with best-sellers (e.g., frames). Initial investments in online infrastructure, tracking systems, and team expansion could yield a high return, with the $9.85M upside and inventory cost savings outweighing costs, enhancing profitability and market share in high-potential markets like the US and Australia.

> Promotions: Scale Volume Discounts in US Southwest/Northwest (+$15.4M historically) and Seasonal Discounts in Q3 (proven US sensitivity).

> Reevaluate Marketing Activities: It's unclear if marketing campaigns were run, but if they were, they did not significantly impact sales. Reevaluate the current marketing strategy and consider switching investments to better channels. Also television ads had low impact, so investment may be better made in other channels, must investigate first.
