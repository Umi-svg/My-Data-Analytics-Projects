This project aim to evaluate and compare two alternative investment scenarios for a startup operating in the smart home industry: a factory expansion strategy and a digital product with marketing-driven growth strategy. Using financial analysis techniques such as discounted cash flow, NPV, IRR, ROI, payback period, and opportunity cost, the project assesses the financial viability and value creation potential of each scenario in order to support data-driven investment decision-making.

**Conclusions:**

- Both projects create value as indicated by positive NPVs and IRRs, meaning each investment exceeds the company’s required return.

- Project 2 significantly outperforms project 1 across all key financial metrics, despite requiring a higher initial investment (€8.0M vs €5.4M).

- Net Present Value comparison strongly favors project 2, with an NPV of €18.0M versus €4.2M for project 1, indicating substantially higher value creation in today’s terms.

- Project 2 generates faster and stronger cash flow growth, with net cash flows turning positive earlier and accelerating sharply after 2020, reflecting the scalability of the digital business model.

- IRR highlights efficiency of capital use, as project 2 achieves a 42% IRR compared to 25% for project 1, suggesting much higher returns per euro invested.

- Project 2 delivers almost 98% ROI versus 28% for project 1, indicating superior profitability relative to total investment costs.

- Payback period is almost similar for both projects, both are in 2022 but a little bit earlier for project 2, despite the project higher upfront investment.

- When it comes to opportunity cost, choosing project 1 implies forgoing €18.0M in value, while choosing project 2 implies giving up only €4.2M, which emphasizes that project 2 is the economically dominant option.

- Risk analysis: project 1 relies on capital-intensive manufacturing growth with ongoing fixed costs, while project 2 benefits from lower marginal costs and higher scalability once the marketing campaign drives adoption, and its full reliance on own funds instead of external investment avoids debt interest.


**Recommendations:**

Project 2 delivers significantly higher NPV, IRR, and ROI while maintaining a comparable payback period indicating a better long-term value creation. Given capital constraints and the mutually exclusive nature of the projects, project 2 should be selected, as rejecting it would result in the highest opportunity cost and a substantial loss of potential shareholder value.
