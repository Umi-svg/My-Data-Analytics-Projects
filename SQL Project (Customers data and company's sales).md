This project aims to create SQL-based reports from AdventureWorks data, including a Customer Overview (top customers, activity flags, inactive segments, North America subset with split addresses and formatted titles) and Monthly Sales Reports (orders, unique customers, salespeople, total with tax, cumulative totals, regional ranks, and country-level tax summaries).
