This project aims to refine and enhance the existing Tableau dashboard by improving labeling, formatting, and color design to align with company branding and ensure color-blind accessibility. It involves creating a cleaner, more interactive dashboard using AdventureWorks data, adding at least one new business insight, implementing a parameter-based custom filter, exploring additional data points, and providing brief analytical conclusions. The final dashboard will be published on Tableau Public for review.

**Analysis and Findings:**
- Sales Trends: Sales grew from June 2001 to May 2004, with revenues of $39.9M in 2002 and $54.3M in 2003 (YoY growth: 178.33% and 36.19%), projecting $90.6M for 2004. Q1 is weakest, with August peaks likely due to summer spending.
- Quarterly Patterns: Second month led sales until June 2003; from July 2003, the third month dominated, driven by price-related sales.
- Geographic Contributions: North America (USA, Canada) accounts for 74% of revenue; USA leads, with GB, France, and Australia growing since 2002-2003.
- Sales Channels: Sales team drives 77% of $140.7M total revenue, with online at 23%; reseller sales dominate.
- Sales Team Performance: Top revenue earners are Linda Mitchell, Jillian Carson, and Michael Blythe; Jae Pak, Mitchell, and Carson lead in average monthly performance, with most exceeding quotas by 11-25%.
- Marketing Performance (Online): Price ($9.06M, 28%), Untracked ($7.66M, 24%), and Promotions ($6.93M, 21.35%) lead online sales; quality drove sales until 2002, then price and promotions took over.
- Data Gaps: 24% of online orders are untracked; sales team orders lack reason tracking.

**Recommendations for Business:**
- Seasonal Focus: Boost summer campaigns in key markets (USA, Canada, GB) and use early-year promotions to counter Q1 dips.
- Sales Team: Train underperformers and incentivize top performers (Jae Pak, Mitchell, Carson).
- Tracking: Implement mandatory sales reason fields for online and sales team orders to improve data accuracy.
- Marketing: Emphasize price/promotion strategies, cut low-impact TV ads, and re-explore quality messaging.
- Market Expansion: Increase efforts in GB, France, and Australia; explore Germany.
- Forecasting: Target $90.6M for 2005, aligning campaigns with the new third-month peak trend.
