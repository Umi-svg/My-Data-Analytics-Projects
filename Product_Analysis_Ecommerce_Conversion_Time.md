Key insights:
- The average time customers spend on the website before purchasing is ~19 mins.
- Returning users consistently convert faster than new users, showing a structural behavior gap.
- Desktop and mobile users have the fastest and most stable conversion times, while tablet show higher friction.
- Higher user activity is associated with longer time to purchase, suggesting exploration or decision complexity.
- Conversion speed and revenue are seasonally impacted, with slower and lower performance post-holidays.

Recommendations for Business:
- Optimize the first-time user experience to reduce time to purchase for new users.
- Improve tablet UX to address higher friction on smaller devices.
- Leverage high-intent periods (midweek, pre-holidays) with targeted campaigns and streamlined flows.
- Use time-to-purchase as an ongoing KPI to monitor funnel efficiency and traffic quality.
